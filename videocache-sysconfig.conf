# Time must be specified in 24 hour format. Also, HH1:MM1 must be less that HH2:MM2. Multiple time
# intervals can be specified by using comma (,) as a separator.
#
# Exmaple: cache_period = 00:20-06:30, 12:30-03:30
# The above cache_period option will force videocache to cache videos only from 00:20AM to 6:30AM and

# ts - Seconds since epoch
# tu - Time in millisecond
# tl - Local Time
# tg - GMT Time
# p  - Process ID of the process logging the message

# %b    Abbreviated month name (Jan, Feb, Mar, ...)
